# Introduction

This is the `iheiddown_betterport` template for the `{iheiddown}`
[@iheiddown] package! Based on the great `{posterdown}` package, it
provides the user with an IHEID version of the template by default. The
original `{posterdown}` template was inspired by the twitter thread of
[Mike
Morrison](https://mobile.twitter.com/mikemorrison/status/1110191245035479041).

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Writing the bibliography of the packages you're using to create the current
# poster is a great way to give credit to the authors of the packages you're
# using.
knitr::write_bib(c('iheiddown',
                   'rmarkdown',
                   'posterdown',
                   'iheiddown'),
                 'packages.bib')
```

## Objectives

1.  Pick a template layout.
2.  Write/ create your poster content distraction free.
3.  Press `CTRL+K` and let `{iheiddown}` do its thing!

Read the guide below (mostly identical to posterdown). It will make you
familiar with the ways of creating a great poster.

# Methods

I will show here how to include poster elements that may be useful, such
as an equation using mathjax:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

To reference a citation you can add your `.bib` file to the working
directory and name it in the YAML metadata or generate an automated one
as done here, then you only need to reference the label value in the
`.bib` file. For example this package is built on top of the wonderful
{pagedown} package and I will cite it at the end of this sentance using
this in the rmd `[@R-pagedown]` [@R-pagedown].

To get a better understanding of how to include features like these
please refer to the {iheiddown}
[wiki](https://github.com/iheiddown/wiki).

***Now on to the results!***

# Results

Here you may have some figures to show off, bellow I have made a
scatterplot with the infamous Iris dataset and I can even reference to
the figure automatically like this, `Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure)`,
Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure).

```{r, irisfigure, fig.cap='Here is a caption for the figure. This can be added by using the "fig.cap" option in the r code chunk options, see this [link](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#plots) from the legend himself, [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui).', out.width="80%"}
par(mar=c(2,2,0,1))
plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width,
     col = iris$Species, pch = 19, xlab = "Sepal Length",
     ylab = "Sepal Width")
```

Maybe you want to show off some of that fancy code you spent so much
time on to make that figure, well you can do that too! Just use the
`echo=TRUE` option in the r code chunk options, Figure
\@ref(fig:myprettycode)!

```{r myprettycode, echo=TRUE, fig.cap='Boxplots, so hot right now!', fig.height=6, out.width="80%"}
#trim whitespace
par(mar=c(2,2,0,0))
#plot boxplots
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Species,
        col = "#ed2215", 
        border = "#800000",
        ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)",
        xlab = "Species")
```

How about a neat table of data? See, Table \@ref(tab:iristable):

```{r, iristable}
knitr::kable(
  iris[1:15,1:5], format = "html",
  caption = "A table made with the **knitr::kable** function.",
  align = "c", col.names = c("Sepal <br> Length",
                             "Sepal <br> Width",
                             "Petal <br> Length",
                             "Petal <br> Width",
                             "Species"),
  escape = FALSE)
```
